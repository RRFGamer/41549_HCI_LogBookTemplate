# B. Stage 1 - Context Definition


# B.1. Competitor Identification
>	The competitor analysis will entail an identification of all competitors, with brief descriptions and a collection of the look and feel of their solutions, e.g., with screenshots, etc. It will also include a detailed analysis of the competitor deemed the best or more representative.



## B.1a. Competitors

## B.1b. Detailed Competitor Analysis
>	Choose the most notable competitor and do a more thorough analysis of their interactive solution


### - Heuristic Evaluation

#### Method
Three usability experts conducted an evaluation using Jakob Nielsenâ€™s Ten Usability Heuristics. Each expert independently identified issues and rated them based on frequency, impact, and persistence.

The severity scale used:
<li> 0 â€“ Not a usability problem </li>
<li> 1 â€“ Cosmetic issue </li>
<li> 2 â€“ Minor issue </li>
<li> 3 â€“ Major issue </li>
<li> 4 â€“ Usability catastrophe </li>

<br>
After individual assessments, the experts discussed discrepancies and reached a consensus on severity ratings.


#### Individual Evaluations

- [expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)

- [expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)


#### Consensus

>	After the individual analysis by each expert, all results should be gathered in a consensus table. If an expert has not found any of the problems found by other experts, they should analyse it, at this point, and give it a severity.

| **Issue**       | **Expert 1** | Expert 2 | Expert 3 | Recommendations                             |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Something wrong | 3            | 1        | 0        | Something could be done to the button to... |
| Another thing   | 4            | 3        | 4        | Other thing to recommend                    |
| ...             |              |          |          |                                             |

### - Cognitive Walkthrough

#### Method
The Cognitive Walkthrough was conducted to analyze how easily a new user can complete key tasks in Google Keep. The method focused on evaluating whether users can understand and execute actions without prior knowledge, identifying usability barriers along the way.

#### Task Selection and Task Analysis

The selected tasks represent common actions users perform in Google Keep. Each task was broken down into its essential subtasks.


| Task                        | Subtasks                               |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **1. Creating and Organizing a Note** | Open Google Keep and tap on "Take a note"     |
|                             | Type text or insert an image/drawing |
|                             | Assign a label, change color, or pin the note      |
|                             | Ensure the note is saved and return to the main view                   |


| Task                          | Subtasks                                |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **1. Setting a Reminder for a Note** | Open Google Keep and choose a note |
|                               | Tap the reminder icon             |
|                               | Choose a time, date and frequency of the reminder             |
|                               | Ensure the reminder is set and visible in the note        |

# B.2. Users
>	For the users, there are two goals: 1) understand the current status of users in the domain you are addressing. How do they manage, what are the main tasks they do, if they use some tool for the purpose, what are current challenges, what might be improved, what might be new features, ...


## B.2a. Method

[What approach was followed to talk with users; what kind of users were considered. What was the goal of the interviews? What were the questions considered?]
