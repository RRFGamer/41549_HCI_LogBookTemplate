## Difficulty Grading

The user graded the difficulty and the observer graded the perceived difficulty
using the following scale:

1. Very Difficult
2. Difficult
3. Average
4. Easy
5. Very Easy

## Tasks

The users were given the following tasks:

1. Create and write a new note with a title ("An amazing note") and add the text
   ("This is a new note"), change the text size (large) and underline it. Save
   the note in a new category, named "generic notes".
2. Find the previously created note ("An amazing note"), knowing that it is part
   of the ("generic notes") category.
3. Open a note from the ("generic notes") category and add the text ("new
   addition") with the blue highlight.
4. Delete the ("generic notes") category, and restore the note titled ("An
   amazing note") and pin that note.

## Post Task Evaluation

After completing **all** tasks, users were presented with a 10 question
questionaire based on SUS (System Usability Scale). The following scale was
used for grading:

1. Strong disagree
2. Disagree
3. Neither agree nor disagree
4. Agree
5. Strong Agree
