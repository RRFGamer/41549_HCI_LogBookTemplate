# Context

Many existing note-taking apps provide a one-size-fits-all approach, often lacking flexibility to create different types of notes, such as recipes, task lists, or quick thoughts. This project explores a different approach by developing a note-taking web application that offers a variety of note types tailored to users' needs. 

# Challenges

<ul>
  <li>Some users avoid note-taking because they find existing apps too complex or unnecessary for their workflow.</li>
  <li>It is difficult to determine what types of notes users actually need, as some are satisfied with traditional one-size-fits-all note-taking apps.</li>
  <li>If a note-taking app offers multiple types of notes, it may become too diverse, potentially overwhelming users instead of improving their experience.</li>
</ul> 


# The goal

To design a simple, user-friendly note-taking web app that allows users to create and manage different types of notes efficiently while focusing on usability and accessibility.
