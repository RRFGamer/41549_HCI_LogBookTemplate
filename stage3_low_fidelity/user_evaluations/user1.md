# User evaluation notes

## User data

- Name: Paulo Dias
- Occupation: Professor

## Task 1

1. Start page
  - Do not start with the interface with a new empty note.
  - The "Change text color" button looks like it changes the size of the text.
2. Save dialog
  - User tried to select category in the side bar before opening the save dialog.
  - "Save in new category" button should be above existing categories.

## Task 2

1. Change the color of the text
  - The user thought that the only way to change the color of the text was to
    paint it, and new text is always the default color.

## Task 3

1. Deleting the category
  - The delete button lacks a confirmation dialog.
2. Restore the note
  - It isn't possible to bulk restore notes.
  - Category and note management differs in the trash and other views.
  - Restore notes appear as a category, or with no category. Restoring a note
    should also restore the category.

## Observations

- Interface
  - It is confusing that open notes appear in the sidebar.
  - Note title appear in up to 3 different places at a time.
  - The button to change color is a brush. It communicates the idea that the
    mouse cursor becomes a brush that can be used to paint text.
  - In the sidebar, uncategorized note could all appear, and categories could
    be collapsed by default.
  - The "Favorites" features is confusing:
    - Favorite notes appear in their own category.
    - Favorite notes should be highlighted in the sidebar.
