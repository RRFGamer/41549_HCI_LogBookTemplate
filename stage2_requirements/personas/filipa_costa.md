**Name:** Filipa Costa
**Age:** 30
**Occupation:** Entrepreneur, part-time employee and student
**Location:** Madrid, Spain

## Background  
Filipa Costa leads a busy and dynamic life, juggling multiple roles as an entrepreneur, a part-time employee in a retail store, and a student taking evening classes. She is also a mother, which adds another layer of complexity to her already packed schedule.

With a background in fashion retail and business management, Filipa started her own small online business, selling handmade accessories. She manages everything from marketing to inventory, often working from her laptop or phone between shifts at her retail job. In the evenings, she attends business management classes to improve her skills and grow her company further.

Filipa relies heavily on notes and to-do lists to stay on top of everything, but she often finds herself struggling to keep them organized across different areas of her life.

## Daily Life  
A typical day for Filipa is fast-paced and highly structured:
- Morning: Wakes up early to prepare breakfast for her child, checks her business emails, and reviews her to-do list for the day.
- Afternoon: Works at the clothing store, where she sometimes takes quick notes on paper or her phone about new ideas for her business.
- Evening: Attends night classes, taking notes on her laptop using Sticky Notes or the default notes app on her phone.
- Late Night: Spends time working on her business, updating product listings, managing customer inquiries, and brainstorming new designs.

Throughout the day, she frequently switches between paper, mobile notes, and Sticky Notes on her computer, but she often forgets where she saved important information.

## Goals & Needs  
<li>Stay organized across multiple areas of life (business, work, studies, and personal life).</li>
<li>Find a note-taking solution that allows her to separate different types of notes (e.g., business, personal, academic).</li>
<li>Use a tool that is customizable but not overwhelming, allowing her to quickly categorize and retrieve notes.</li>
<li>Keep important notes always visible to avoid forgetting them.</li>

## Pain Points & Challenges  
<li>Default note apps feel too basic, making organization difficult.</li>
<li>Complex apps like Notion feel overwhelming, with too many options she doesnâ€™t need.</li>
<li>She often forgets to check her notes, which leads to missed tasks and deadlines.</li>
<li>No easy way to set priorities or reminders in most simple note-taking apps.</li>
