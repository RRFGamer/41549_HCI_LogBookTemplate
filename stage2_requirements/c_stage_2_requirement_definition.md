# Scenarios


## Scenario 1: Afonso Tries to Stay Organized Before Exams

Afonso has a midterm exam coming up, and he realizes that his notes are scattered across different apps, screenshots, and loose text files. He initially tried **Notion**, but it was too overwhelming with all different features and customization options. He switched to his pc default notes app, but now he has a mess of untitled notes with no clear organization.

Desperate for a solution, Afonso downloads **[ALGUMA COISA]**, which promises **simplicity with just enough customization**. He quickly **creates folders** for each subject, **assigns colors** to differentiate topics, and **pins important notes** at the top.

As he reviews his notes, he realizes some sections are more important than others. Unlike his default notes app, **[ALGUMA COISA]** allows him to **adjust text size**, **bold key concepts**, and **highlight important formulas in different colors**. This helps him scan through his notes faster and focus on crucial points. With minimal setup, his study materials are finally structured, allowing him to focus on revision rather than searching for scattered information.
